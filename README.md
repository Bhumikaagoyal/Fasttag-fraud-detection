# Fasttag-fraud-detection using neural networks
The dataset comprises key features such  as transaction details, vehicle information, geographical location, and transaction amounts. The goal  is to create a robust model that can accurately identify instances of fraudulent activity, ensuring the  integrity and security of Fastag transactions
Dataset Description:
1. Transaction_ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
2. Timestamp: Date and time of the transaction.
3. Vehicle_Type: Type of vehicle involved in the transaction.
4. FastagID: Unique identifier for Fastag.
5. TollBoothID: Identifier for the toll booth.
6. Lane_Type: Type of lane used for the transaction.
7. Vehicle_Dimensions: Dimensions of the vehicle.
8. Transaction_Amount: Amount associated with the transaction.
9. Amount_paid: Amount paid for the transaction.
10. Geographical_Location: Location details of the transaction.
11. Vehicle_Speed: Speed of the vehicle during the transaction.
12. Vehicle_Plate_Number: License plate number of the vehicle.
13. Fraud_indicator: Binary indicator of fraudulent activity (target variable)

Challenges:
- Imbalanced dataset issues due to the likely low occurrence of fraud.
- Feature engineering to capture nuanced patterns indicative of fraud.
Evaluation Criteria:
- Model performance assessed using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.
Deliverables:
- Trained machine learning model for Fastag fraud detection.
- Evaluation metrics and analysis report.
- Documentation on relevant features and their impact on fraud detection.
Expected Outcome:
- An effective and scalable Fastag fraud detection system capable of minimizing financial losses and 
ensuring the security of digital toll transactions
